                <p>Martin Luther King was a Baptist minister, who led the Civil Rights movement. He is famous for the
                    March on Washington and his “I Have A Dream” speech. His leadership was crucial to the success of
                    the Civil Rights Movement and ending the legal segregation in the South and all across the U.S that
                    African Americans were subjected to. He was influential in the making of the Civil Rights Act of
                    1964 and the Voting Rights Act. Because of all this and more, there is a holiday named for him:
                    Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In this website, I will be discussing the life of MLK and just what
                    makes him one of the key figures of the 20th century.

            <h2>MLK’s Childhood and Young Adulthood</h2>
            <p>Michael Luther King Jr. was born on January 15th, 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia, to Reverend Michael King Sr.
                and Alberta King (nee Williams). He came from a comfortable middle-class black family that was immersed
                in the tradition of the Southern Black ministry. Both his father and maternal grandfather were baptist
                preachers, his father being the pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church.</p>
            <p>King had a good childhood, growing up on Auburn Avenue, otherwise known as “Black Wall Street”. It was
                where some of the countries biggest and most successful Black businesses were. Growing up here, King had
                a good education and a loving family.</p>

            <figure class="img-div">
                <img src="https://rioschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mlk-as-a-kid.png" alt="MLK as a child">
                <figcaption class="img-caption"> MLK as a child</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>A key moment in his childhood occurred when was 6. One of his close white playmates told him that his
                parents would no longer allow King to play with him because they were attending segregated schools.</p>
            <p>King cared deeply for his maternal grandmother, and her death in 1941 left him unsettled and unstable.
                When his parents told him of her fatal heart attack, the 12 year old Martin tried to kill himself by
                jumping off a second story window.</p>
            <p>In 1944, during World War II, a 15 year old King entered Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. Before
                this though, he spent his summer on a tobacco farm in Connecticut. This was his first time away from
                home and his first considerable experience of race relations up in the North. King was astounded by how
                peacefully races mixed in the North compared to the South. “Negroes and whites go [to] the same church,”
                he wrote
                in a letter to his parents. “I never [thought] that a person of my race could eat anywhere.”</p>
            <p>This summer experience in the North only made King hate racial segregation even more than he originally
                did.
            </p>
            <p>At Morehouse, King originally favoured studies in medicine and law, but eventually decided to turn to
                ministry, just as his father recommended.</p>
            <p>King’s mentor there was Benjamin Mays, the college president at Morehouse, and a gospel activist who was
                devoted to fighting for racial equality. Mays accused the African American community of accepting
                oppression and complacency. He encouraged the Black church into social action by criticizing its
                emphasis on the henceforth instead of the now.</p>

            <p>King graduated from Morehouse in 1948 and spent the next three years at Crozer Theological Seminary,
                Pennsylvania. It was there where he was introduced to Mohandas Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolent
                protest. He earned a bachelor of divinity degree in 1951.</p>
            <p>Distinguished for his public speaking skills, King was elected president of Crozer’s student body, which
                was mostly white students.</p>
            <p>After Crozer, MLK went to Boston University, where studied man’s relationship to God and received a
                doctorate (1955), for his essay entitled “A Comparison of Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul
                Tillich and Henry Nelson”.</p>

            <h2>MLK's Leadership in the Montgomery Bus Boycott</h2>
            <p>While in Boston, King met and fell in love with Coretta Scott, a Alabamian who was studying at the New
                England Conservatory of Music. They married in 1953 and had four kids.</p>

            <p> King had been pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama for more than a year
                when
                the city’s group of civil rights activists decided to challenge racial segregation on the city’s public
                bus
                system.</p>

            <p> This was after the arrest of Rosa Parks, an African American woman who refused to surrender her seat to
                a
                white passenger and was arrested for violating the city’s segregation law.</p>
            <p> The activists formed the Montgomery Improvement Association to boycott the system, choosing King as the
                leader.</p>

        <section id="sclc">
            <h2>The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the March On Washington</h2>
            <p>Realizing that a mass movement was needed for a successful boycott, MLK organized the Southern Christian
                Leadership Conference, as well as a national platform to speak on.</p>
            <p> King lectured all over the nation about racial issues with religious and civil rights leaders. He even
                lectured in places beyond the United States.</p>
            <p> He was warmly welcomed by the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and others. King became even
                more
                convinced after a brief discussion with followers of Gandhi that nonviolent protest was the most
                effective
                and powerful weapon for change and the struggle for freedom.</p>

            </figure>

            <p> In 1960, King and his family moved to his hometown Atlanta, where he co-pastored with his father at the
                Ebenezer Baptist Church. He dedicated most of his time to the SCLC and the civil rights movement.</p>
            <p> He agreed to support the sit-in demonstrations started by the local black college. However, he was
                arrested in October along with 33 other people for protesting segregation at the lunch counter in an
                Atlanta department store. He was sentenced to the Reidsville State Prison Farm for violating his
                probation on a minor traffic offense committed many months earlier.</p>
            <p> The case gained national interest with many concerned over his safety, anger at Georgia’s defiance of
                legal forms, and the failure of President Dwight Eisenhower to intervene. Due to John F. Kennedy’s
                intervention, MLK was released from the prison farm, an act which proved to be instrumental in JFK’s
                victory in the presidential election days later.</p>
            <p> King’s popularity and influence reached its heights from 1960 to 1965. He swiftly caught the attention
                of the media, particularly the producers of something that could and would bring about social change:
                television.</p>
            <p>King understood that television could bring about change since it could nationalize and even
                internationalize the struggle for racial equality. He invented tactics of publicizing non-violence, such
                as sit-ins and marches, and induced the allegiance of many African Americans and liberal whites all
                across the country. He also got the support of President JFK and Lyndon B. Johnson’s administrations.

            <p>In 1963, King and other civil rights leaders organized the historic March on Washington. More than
                200,000 people gathered peacefully on August 28th, 1963 in the Lincoln Memorial to demand justice
                for all citizens.</p>
            <p>It was here that King spoke his famous “I Have A Dream” speech, where he emphasized his belief that
                one day all men would be brothers.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP4iY1TtS3s" target="blank">
                    Here is a link to his speech on Youtube </a></p>
            <p>Afterwards, the civil rights agitation had a strong effect on the national opinion of the Civil
                Rights Movement, and resulted in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
            <p>MLK also received the Nobel Peace Prize that same year in Oslo in the month of December.</p>

            <h2>Opposition to Non-Violent Protest During MLK’s Final Years</h2>
            <p>King’s tactics were first opposed during the demonstrations in Selma, Alabama, which were focused on
                voting rights for black people. King organized the march from Selma to the state capitol building in
                Montgomery. However, he didn’t actually lead the march himself. The marchers were pushed back by
                state troopers with teargas and nightsticks in an event that would eventually be called “Bloody
                Sunday”.</p>
            <p>Despite this, King was intent on organizing a second march, despite opposition from the federal court
                and Washington, trying to persuade him to cancel it. He led 1,500 marchers, black and white, across
                the Pettus Bridge outside Selma until the group was stopped by a blockade of state troopers. </p>

            </figure>

            <p>Instead of forcing a conflict, he led his followers to kneel and pray, then turned back. Many young
                supporters were antipathetic to this, criticizing him for being too passive and cautious.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the march piqued the interest of the country, resulting in the Voting Rights Act of
                1965.</p>
            <p>As time went by, King was increasingly criticized by young Black-power enthusiasts for his nonviolent
                ways. Malcolm X, another popular Civil Rights activist, even went as far as to call his tactics
                “criminal”. He said this: “Concerning nonviolence, it is criminal to teach a man not to defend
                himself when he is the constant victim of brutal attacks.”</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Although he was facing rising criticism, he broadened his approach to issues other than racism.
                During the 60’s, the Vietnam War was still raging and the U.S was involved in the conflict. King
                decided to oppose the U.S involvement in the Vietnam War. However, this sparked opposition from
                Washington and within the Black community. MLK also decided to oppose poverty in all races.</p>
            <p>The changing ways of the Civil Rights movement and the constant pressure weighed on King, especially near
                the end of his life. Still, King persevered through all the criticism he was facing, all the way
                to the very end.</p>
            <p>While standing on a balcony of the Lorraine Motel on the second story, MLK was shot and killed. His
                murder sparked riots all across the country. On March 10, 1969, James Earl Ray was accused and pleaded
                guilty for the murder, being sentenced to 99 years in prison. There are many conspiracy theories that
                Ray was innocent of his crime; he later claimed that the lawyers pressured him to confess.</p>

            <h2>MLK’s Legacy</h2>
            <p>Martin Luther King Jr. will forever be remembered as a crucial leader for the Civil Rights movement.
                Although he may have been criticized for his nonviolent tactics, it is these tactics that helped bring
                about real change for people of color.</p>
            <p>For years after he died, people called for a holiday to be named after him. It took time for this to
                happen. Some argued that, because of FBI surveillance files claiming that he had many adulterous
                affairs, he was undeserving of a holiday named after him. Eventually though, he did have a holiday named
                after him, the Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which is celebrated on his birthday. This day is meant to
                honor him and all the contributions he made to the Civil Rights Movement. People throw parades and great
                celebrations every year in honor of this holiday.</p>
            <p>I hope you learned something new about MLK from this website. Thanks for reading!</p>
